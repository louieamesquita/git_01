## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
Little Birds are dining    
   Warily and well,    
  Hid in mossy cell:    
 Hid, I say, by waiters    
Gorgeous in their gaiters -  
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two fairies it was  
On a still summer day  
Came forth in the woods  
With the flowers to play.  
The flowers they plucked  
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night  
  
The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."   
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In the land of ash and fading light,  
Where shadows dance in eternal night,  
A tale unfolds, of courage and dread,  
Dark Souls 3, where heroes tread.  
  
From Lothric's walls to Irithyll's frost,  
A world consumed, its glory lost,  
A lone Ashen One, wielding their might,  
To link the fire, to end the blight.  
  
Through treacherous lands, they forge ahead,  
Past dragons, demons, and the undead,  
Their journey fraught with trials profound,  
As death's embrace is always found.  
  
The Abyss watchers, their swords ablaze,  
Defend against the darkness' craze,  
The Farron's Keep, with poison's snare,  
Challenges souls brave enough to dare.  
  
High Lord Wolnir, the conqueror grim,  
Beneath the catacombs, where shadows swim,  
His skeletal hands, grasping for might,  
To rule the kingdoms, eternal night.  
  
Yhorm the Giant, a lonely soul,  
A giant's burden, a tragic role,  
His mighty storm ruler, a relic of old,  
A king betrayed, his heart turned cold.  
  
Aldrich, Devourer of Gods, with gluttonous lust,  
Feasting on deities, in his ageless disgust,  
A twisted being, corrupted by greed,  
A nightmare born from a noble creed.  
  
Pontiff Sulyvahn, a ruler unjust,  
Wielding moonlight's wrath, in his icy thrust,  
His Pontiff Knights, loyal but blind,  
Their blades dance, leaving foes behind.  
  
The consumed King, Oceiros the mad,  
Cradling his child, his sanity clad,  
In the Gardens of Lothric, where secrets lie,  
A royal bloodline, bound to the sky.  
  
The Dancer of the Boreal Valley, graceful and dire,  
With every spin, death draws nigher,  
A tragic ballerina, cursed and bound,  
To haunt the castle, with no resound.  
  
Lorian, the elder prince, crippled and worn,  
His bond with Lothric, unbroken, forlorn,  
Together they face the Ashen One's might,  
In a final struggle, as darkness takes flight.  
  
At the Kiln of the First Flame, destiny's call,  
The Ashen One stands, ready to fall,  
Against the Soul of Cinder, a final trial,  
A culmination of strength, a battle worthwhile.  
  
With Gwyn's legacy burning bright,  
The Ashen One fights with all their might,  
To decide the fate of this dying land,  
To let the fire fade or take a stand.  
  
Dark Souls 3, a journey profound,  
Where heroes rise and darkness is crowned,  
In a realm where hope and despair entwine,  
The legacy of ashes, forever divine.
